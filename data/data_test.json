This shows that\n$$\nV=U+\\operatorname{null} T\n$$\nNow, let $v \\in U \\cap \\operatorname{null} T$.\nSince $v \\in U, u$ can be expressed as a linear combination of basis vectors of $U$. Let\n$$\nv=a_1 u_1+\\cdots+a_n u_n\n$$\nSimilarly, since $v \\in \\operatorname{null} T$, it can also be expressed as a tinear combination of the basis vectors of null $T$. Let\n$$\nv=c_1 v_1+\\cdots+c_m v_m\n$$\nThe left hand sides of the above two equations are equal. Therefore, we can equate the right hand sides.\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& a_1 u_1+\\cdots+a_n u_n=v=c_1 v_1+\\cdots+c_m v_m \\\\\n& a_1 u_1+\\cdots+a_n u_n-c_1 v_1-\\cdots-c_m v_m=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nWe have found a linear combination of $u_i^{\\prime}$ 's and $v_i$ 's which is equal to zero. However, they are basis vectors of $V$. Hence, all the multipliers $c_i$ 's and $a_i$ 's must be zero implying that $v=0$.\nTherefore, if $v \\in U \\cap$ null $T$, then $v=0$. this means that\n$$\nU \\cap \\operatorname{null} T=\\{0\\}\n$$\nThe above shows that $U$ satisfies the first of the required conditions.\nNow let $w \\in$ range $T$. Then, there exists $v \\in V$ such that $T v=w$. This allows us to write $v=u+w$ where $u \\in U$ and $w \\in$ null $T$. This implies\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nw & =T v \\\\\n& =T(u+w) \\\\\n& =T u+T w \\\\\n& =T u+0 \\quad \\quad(\\text { since } w \\in \\operatorname{null} T) \\\\\n& =T u\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThis shows that if $w \\in$ range $T$ then $w=T u$ for some $u \\in U$. Therefore, range $T \\subseteq\\{T u \\mid u \\in U\\}$.\nSince $U$ is a subspace of $V$, it follows that $T u \\in$ range $T$ for all $u \\in U$. Thus, $\\{T u \\mid u \\in U\\} \\subseteq$ range $T$.\nTherefore, range $T=\\{T u \\mid u \\in U\\}$.\nThis shows that $U$ satisfies the second required condition as well.\nQed.",

We start by claiming that there exist constants $C_1, C_2>0$ such that\n$$\nC_1\\|x\\|_E \\leq\\|x\\| \\leq C_2\\|x\\|_E, \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}^m .\n$$\nAssuming (1) to be true, let us finish the problem. First let us show that $B$ is bounded w.r.t. $d_E$, which is how we call the Euclidean distance in $\\mathbb{R}^m$. Indeed, given $x \\in B,\\|x\\|_E \\leq \\frac{1}{C_1}\\|x\\| \\leq \\frac{1}{C_1}$. Hence $B \\subset\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^m: d_E(x, 0)<\\frac{1}{C_1}+1\\right\\}$, which means $B$ is bounded w.r.t $d_E$.\nNow let us show that $B$ is closed w.r.t. $d_E$. Let $x_n \\rightarrow x$ w.r.t. $d_E$, where $x_n \\in B$. Notice that this implies that $x_n \\rightarrow x$ w.r.t. $d(x, y)=\\|x-y\\|$, the distance coming from $\\|\\cdot\\|$, since by (1) we have\n$$\nd\\left(x_n, x\\right)=\\left\\|x_n-x\\right\\| \\leq C_2\\left\\|x_n-x\\right\\|_E \\rightarrow 0 .\n$$\nAlso, notice that\n$$\n\\|x\\| \\leq\\left\\|x_n-x\\right\\|+\\left\\|x_n\\right\\| \\leq\\left\\|x_n-x\\right\\|+1,\n$$\nhence passing to the limit we obtain that $\\|x\\| \\leq 1$, therefore $x \\in B$ and so $B$ is closed w.r.t. $d_E$. Since $B$ is closed and bounded w.r.t. $d_E$, it must be compact.

This follows by (1), since $i d$ is always a bijection, and it is continuous and its inverse is continuous by (1) (if $x_n \\rightarrow x$ w.r.t. $d_E$, then $x_n \\rightarrow x$ w.r.t. $d$ and vice-versa, by (1)). By a result we saw in class, since $B$ is compact in $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^m, d_E\\right)$ and $i d$ is a homeomorphism, then $i d(B)=B$ is compact w.r.t. $d$.\n\nWe are left with proving (1).

Indeed, if this is true, given $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, either $\\|x\\|_E=0$ (which implies $x=0$ and (1) holds in this case), or $x /\\|x\\|_E=y$ is such that $\\|y\\|_E=1$, so $C_1 \\leq\\|y\\| \\leq C_2$, which implies $C_1\\|x\\|_E \\leq\\|x\\| \\leq C_2\\|x\\|_E$.\nWe want to show now that $\\|\\cdot\\|$ is continuous w.r.t. $d_E$, that is, given $\\varepsilon>0$ and $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, there exists $\\delta>0$ such that if $d_E(x, y)<\\delta$, then $\\|\\mid x\\|-\\|y\\| \\|<\\varepsilon$.\n\nBy the triangle inequality, $\\|x\\|-\\|y\\| \\leq\\|x-y\\|$, and $\\|y\\|-\\|x\\| \\leq\\|x-y\\|$, therefore\n$$\n|\\|x||-\\| y|\\|\\leq\\| x-y \\| .\n$$\nWriting now $x=\\sum_{i=1}^m a_i e_i, y=\\sum_{i=1}^m b_i e_i$, where $e_i=(0, \\ldots, 1,0, \\ldots, 0)$ (with 1 in the i-th component), we obtain by the triangle inequality,\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\|x-y\\| & =\\left\\|\\sum_{i=1}^m\\left(a_i-b_i\\right) e_i\\right\\| \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^m\\left|a_i-b_i\\left\\|\\left|\\left\\|e_i\\right\\| \\leq \\max _{i=1, \\ldots, m}\\left\\|e_i\\right\\| \\sum_{i=1}^m\\right| a_i-b_i \\mid\\right.\\right. \\\\\n& =\\max _{i=1, \\ldots, m}\\left\\|e_i\\right\\| d_{s u m}(x, y) \\leq \\max _{i=1, \\ldots, m}\\left\\|e_i\\right\\| m d_{\\max }(x, y) \\\\\n& \\leq \\max _{i=1, \\ldots, m}\\left\\|e_i\\right\\| m d_E(x, y) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nLet $\\delta=\\frac{\\varepsilon}{m \\max _{i=1, \\ldots, m}\\left\\|e_i\\right\\|}$.

For each pair of points $x \\in O, y \\in O$, we define an equivalence relation $x \\sim y$ by saying $x \\sim y$ if and only if $[\\min (x, y), \\max (x, y)] \\subset$ 0 . This is an equivalence relation, since $x \\sim x([x, x] \\subset O$ if $x \\in O)$; if $x \\sim y$, then $y \\sim x$ (since $\\min (x, y)=\\min (y, x)$ and $\\max (x, y)=\\max (y, x))$; and if $x \\sim y$ and $y \\sim z$, then $x \\sim z([\\min (x, z), \\max (x, z)] \\subseteq[\\min (x, y), \\max (x, y)] \\cup$ $[\\min (y, z), \\max (y, z)] \\subseteq O)$. In fact it is easy to prove that\n$$\n\\min (x, z) \\geq \\min (\\min (x, y), \\min (y, z))\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\max (x, z) \\leq \\max (\\max (x, y), \\max (y, z))\n$$\nIt follows that $O$ can be written as a disjoint union of pairwise disjoint equivalence classes. We claim that each equivalence class is an open interval.\n\nTo show this, for each $x \\in O$; let $A=\\{z:[z, x] \\subseteq O\\}$ and $B=\\{z:[x, z] \\subseteq$ $O\\}$, and let $a=\\inf A, b=\\sup B$. We claim that $(a, b) \\subset O$. Indeed if $a<z<b$, there exists $c \\in A$ with $c<z$ and $d \\in B$ with $d>z$. Then $z \\in[c, x] \\cup[x, d] \\subseteq O$. We now claim that $(a, b)$ is the equivalence class containing $x$. It is clear that each element of $(a, b)$ is equivalent to $x$ by the way in which $a$ and $b$ were chosen. We need to show that if $z \\notin(a, b)$, then $z$ is not equivalent to $x$. Suppose that $z<a$. If $z$ were equivalent to $x$, then $[z, x]$ would be contained in $O$, and so we would have $z \\in A$. Hence $a$ would not be a lower bound for $A$. Similarly if $z>b$ and $z \\sim x$, then $b$ could not be an upper bound for $B$.\n\nWe have now established that $O$ is a union of pairwise disjoint open intervals. Such a union must be at most countable, since each open interval contains a rational number not in any other interval.\nQed.",
