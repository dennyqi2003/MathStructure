Exercise 2.28 Prove that every closed set in a separable metric space is the union of a (possibly empty) perfect set and a set which is at most countable.
Proof.
If $E$ is closed, it contains all its limit points, and hence certainly all its condensation points. Thus $E=P \cup(E \backslash P)$, where $P$ is perfect (the set of all condensation points of $E$ ), and $E \backslash P$ is at most countable.

Since a perfect set in a separable metric space has the same cardinality as the real numbers, the set $P$ must be empty if $E$ is countable. The at-mostcountable set $E \backslash P$ cannot be perfect, hence must have isolated points if it is nonempty.
