Exercise 5.3.7 If $a \in K$ is such that $a^2$ is algebraic over the subfield $F$ of $K$, show that a is algebraic over $F$.
Proof.
Since $a^2$ is algebraic over $F$, there exist a non-zero polynomial $f(x)$ in $F[x]$ such that $f\left(a^2\right)=0$. Consider a new polynomial $g(x)$ defined as $g(x)=f\left(x^2\right)$. Clearly $g(x) \in F[x]$ and $g(a)=f\left(a^2\right)= 0$.
