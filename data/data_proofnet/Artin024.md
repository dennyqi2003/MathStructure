Exercise 11.4.6c Prove that $x^3 - 9$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{F}_{31}$.
Proof.
If $p(x) = x^3-9$ were reducible, it would have a linear factor, since it either has a linear factor and a quadratic factor or three linear factors. We can then verify by brute force that $p(x)\neq 0$ for $x \in \mathbb{F}_31$.
