Exercise 1.6 Give an example of a nonempty subset $U$ of $\mathbf{R}^2$ such that $U$ is closed under addition and under taking additive inverses (meaning $-u \in U$ whenever $u \in U$), but $U$ is not a subspace of $\mathbf{R}^2$.
Proof.
\[U=\mathbb{Z}^2=\left\{(x, y) \in \mathbf{R}^2: x, y \text { are integers }\right\}\]
$U=\mathbb{Z}^2$ satisfies the desired properties. To come up with this, note by assumption, $U$ must be closed under addition and subtraction, so in particular, it must contain 0 . We need to find a set which fails scalar multiplication. A discrete set like $\mathbb{Z}^2$ does this.
