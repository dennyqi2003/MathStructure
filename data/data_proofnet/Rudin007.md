Exercise 1.11a If $z$ is a complex number, prove that there exists an $r\geq 0$ and a complex number $w$ with $| w | = 1$ such that $z = rw$.
Proof.
If $z=0$, we take $r=0, w=1$. (In this case $w$ is not unique.) Otherwise we take $r=|z|$ and $w=z /|z|$, and these choices are unique, since if $z=r w$, we must have $r=r|w|=|r w|=|z|, z / r$
