Exercise 3.5.6 Let $V$ be a vector space which is spanned by a countably infinite set. Prove that every linearly independent subset of $V$ is finite or countably infinite.
Proof.
Let $A$ be the countable generating set, and let $U$ be an uncountable linearly independent set. It can be extended to a basis $B$ of the whole space. Now consider the subset $C$ of elements of $B$ that appear in the $B$-decompositions of elements of $A$.
Since only finitely many elements are involved in the decomposition of each element of $A$, the set $C$ is countable. But $C$ also clearly generates the vector space $V$. This contradicts the fact that it is a proper subset of the basis $B$ (since $B$ is uncountable).
