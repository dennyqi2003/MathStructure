Exercise 2.4.4 Prove that if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ then $H$ is generated by the set $H-\{1\}$.
Proof.
If $H=\{1\}$ then $H-\{1\}$ is the empty set which indeed generates the trivial subgroup $H$. So suppose $|H|>1$ and pick a nonidentity element $h \in H$. Since $1=h h^{-1} \in\langle H-\{1\}\rangle$ (Proposition 9), we see that $H \leq\langle H-\{1\}\rangle$. By minimality of $\langle H-\{1\}\rangle$, the reverse inclusion also holds so that $\langle H-\{1\}\rangle=$ $H$.
