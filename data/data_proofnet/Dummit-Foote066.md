Exercise 7.1.15 A ring $R$ is called a Boolean ring if $a^{2}=a$ for all $a \in R$. Prove that every Boolean ring is commutative.
Proof.
Solution: Note first that for all $a \in R$,
$$
-a=(-a)^2=(-1)^2 a^2=a^2=a .
$$
Now if $a, b \in R$, we have
$$
a+b=(a+b)^2=a^2+a b+b a+b^2=a+a b+b a+b .
$$
Thus $a b+b a=0$, and we have $a b=-b a$. But then $a b=b a$. Thus $R$ is commutative.
