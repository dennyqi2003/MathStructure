Exercise 4.5.1a Prove that if $P \in \operatorname{Syl}_{p}(G)$ and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ containing $P$ then $P \in \operatorname{Syl}_{p}(H)$.
Proof.
If $P \leq H \leq G$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$, then $p$ does not divide $[G: P]$. Now $[G: P]=[G: H][H: P]$, so that $p$ does not divide $[H: P]$; hence $P$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$.
