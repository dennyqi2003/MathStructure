Exercise 1.18a If $k \geq 2$ and $\mathbf{x} \in R^{k}$, prove that there exists $\mathbf{y} \in R^{k}$ such that $\mathbf{y} \neq 0$ but $\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{y}=0$
Proof.
If $\mathbf{x}$ has any components equal to 0 , then $\mathbf{y}$ can be taken to have the corresponding components equal to 1 and all others equal to 0 . If all the components of $\mathbf{x}$ are nonzero, $\mathbf{y}$ can be taken as $\left(-x_2, x_1, 0, \ldots, 0\right)$. This is, of course, not true when $k=1$, since the product of two nonzero real numbers is nonzero.
