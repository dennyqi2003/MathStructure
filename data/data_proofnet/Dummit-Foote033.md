Exercise 3.3.3 Prove that if $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ of prime index $p$ then for all $K \leq G$ either $K \leq H$, or $G=H K$ and $|K: K \cap H|=p$.
Proof.
Solution: Suppose $K \backslash N \neq \emptyset$; say $k \in K \backslash N$. Now $G / N \cong \mathbb{Z} /(p)$ is cyclic, and moreover is generated by any nonidentity- in particular by $\bar{k}$

Now $K N \leq G$ since $N$ is normal. Let $g \in G$. We have $g N=k^a N$ for some integer a. In particular, $g=k^a n$ for some $n \in N$, hence $g \in K N$. We have $[K: K \cap N]=p$ by the Second Isomorphism Theorem.
