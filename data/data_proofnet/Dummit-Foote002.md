Exercise 1.1.3 Prove that the addition of residue classes $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is associative.
Proof.
We have
$$
\begin{aligned}
(\bar{a}+\bar{b})+\bar{c} &=\overline{a+b}+\bar{c} \\
&=\overline{(a+b)+c} \\
&=\overline{a+(b+c)} \\
&=\bar{a}+\overline{b+c} \\
&=\bar{a}+(\bar{b}+\bar{c})
\end{aligned}
$$
since integer addition is associative.
