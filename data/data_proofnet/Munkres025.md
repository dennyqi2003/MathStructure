Exercise 22.2b If $A \subset X$, a retraction of $X$ onto $A$ is a continuous map $r: X \rightarrow A$ such that $r(a)=a$ for each $a \in A$. Show that a retraction is a quotient map.
Proof.
The inclusion map $i: A \rightarrow X$ is continuous and $r \circ i=1_A$ is the identity. Thus $r$ is a quotient map by (a).
