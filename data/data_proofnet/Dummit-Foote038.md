Exercise 3.4.11 Prove that if $H$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup of the solvable group $G$ then there is a nontrivial subgroup $A$ of $H$ with $A \unlhd G$ and $A$ abelian.
Proof.
Suppose $H$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup of the solvable group $G$.
First, notice that $H$, being a subgroup of a solvable group, is itself solvable. By exercise $8, H$ has a chain of subgroups
$$
1 \leq H_1 \leq \ldots \leq H
$$
such that each $H_i$ is a normal subgroup of $H$ itself and $H_{i+1} / H_i$ is abelian. But then the first group in the series
$$
H_1 / 1 \cong H
$$
is an abelian subgroup of $H$.
