Exercise 4.5.20 Prove that if $|G|=1365$ then $G$ is not simple.
Proof.
Since $|G|=1365=3.5.7.13$, $G$ has $13-$Sylow subgroup of order $13$. Now, we count the number of such subgroups. Let $n_{13}$ be the number of $13-$Sylow subgroup. Now $n_{13}=1+13k$ where $1+13k|3.5.7$. The choices for $k$ is $0$. Hence, there is a unique $13-$Sylow subgroup and hence is normal. so $G$ is not simple.
