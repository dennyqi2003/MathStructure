Exercise 2.5.37 If $G$ is a nonabelian group of order 6, prove that $G \simeq S_3$.
Proof.
Suppose $G$ is a non-abelian group of order 6 . We need to prove that $G \cong S_3$. Since $G$ is non-abelian, we conclude that there is no element of order 6. Now all the nonidentity element has order either 2 or 3 . All elements cannot be order 3 .This is because except the identity elements there are 5 elements, but order 3 elements occur in pair, that is $a, a^2$, both have order 3 , and $a \neq a^2$. So, this is a contradiction, as there are only 5 elements. So, there must be an element of order 2 . All elements of order 2 will imply that $G$ is abelian, hence there is also element of order 3 . Let $a$ be an element of order 2 , and $b$ be an element of order 3 . So we have $e, a, b, b^2$, already 4 elements. Now $a b \neq e, b, b^2$. So $a b$ is another element distinct from the ones already constructed. $a b^2 \neq e, b, a b, b^2, a$. So, we have got another element distinct from the other. So, now $ G=\left\{e, a, b, b^2, a b, a b^2\right\}$. Also, ba must be equal to one of these elements. But $b a \neq e, a, b, b^2$. Also if $b a=a b$, the group will become abelian. so $b a=a b^2$. So what we finally get is $G=\left\langle a, b \mid a^2=e=b^3, b a=a b^2\right\rangle$. Hence $G \cong S_3$.
