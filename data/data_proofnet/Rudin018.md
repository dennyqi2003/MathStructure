Exercise 2.25 Prove that every compact metric space $K$ has a countable base.
Proof.
$K$ can be covered by a finite union of neighborhoods of radius $1 / n$, and this shows that this implies that $K$ is separable.

It is not entirely obvious that a metric space with a countable base is separable. To prove this, let $\left\{V_n\right\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a countable base, and let $x_n \in V_n$. The points $V_n$ must be dense in $X$. For if $G$ is any non-empty open set, then $G$ contains $V_n$ for some $n$, and hence $x_n \in G$. (Thus for a metric space, having a countable base and being separable are equivalent.)
