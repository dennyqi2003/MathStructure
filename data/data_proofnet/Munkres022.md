Exercise 21.6b Define $f_{n}:[0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by the equation $f_{n}(x)=x^{n}$. Show that the sequence $\left(f_{n}\right)$ does not converge uniformly.
Proof.
The sequence $\left(f_n\right)_n$ does not converge uniformly, since given $0<\varepsilon<1$ and $N \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}$, for $x=\varepsilon^{1 / N}$ we have $d\left(f_N(x), f(x)\right)=\varepsilon$. We can also apply Theorem 21.6: the convergence is not uniform since $f$ is not continuous.
