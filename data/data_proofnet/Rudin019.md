Exercise 2.27a Suppose $E\subset\mathbb{R}^k$ is uncountable, and let $P$ be the set of condensation points of $E$. Prove that $P$ is perfect.
Proof.
We see that $E \cap W$ is at most countable, being a countable union of at-most-countable sets. It remains to show that $P=W^c$, and that $P$ is perfect.
