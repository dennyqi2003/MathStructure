Exercise 13.5b Show that if $\mathcal{A}$ is a subbasis for a topology on $X$, then the topology generated by $\mathcal{A}$ equals the intersection of all topologies on $X$ that contain $\mathcal{A}$.
Proof.
If we now considered $\mathcal{A}$ as a subbasis, then the elements of $\mathcal{T}$ are union of finite intersections of elements of $\mathcal{A}$. The inclusion $\mathcal{O} \subset \mathcal{T}$ is again clear and $\mathcal{T} \subset \mathcal{O}$ holds since every union of finite intersections of elements of $\mathcal{A}$ belongs to $\mathcal{O}$.
