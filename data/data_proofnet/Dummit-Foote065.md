Exercise 7.1.12 Prove that any subring of a field which contains the identity is an integral domain.
Proof.
Solution: Let $R \subseteq F$ be a subring of a field. (We need not yet assume that $1 \in R$ ). Suppose $x, y \in R$ with $x y=0$. Since $x, y \in F$ and the zero element in $R$ is the same as that in $F$, either $x=0$ or $y=0$. Thus $R$ has no zero divisors. If $R$ also contains 1 , then $R$ is an integral domain.
