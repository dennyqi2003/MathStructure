Exercise 6.4.12 Prove that no group of order 224 is simple.
Proof.
The following proves there must exist a normal Sylow 2 -subgroup of order 32 ,
Suppose there are $n_2=7$ Sylow 2 -subgroups in $G$. Making $G$ act on the set of these Sylow subgroups by conjugation (Mitt wrote about this but on the set of the other Sylow subgroups, which gives no contradiction), we get a homomorphism $G \rightarrow S_7$ which must be injective if $G$ is simple (why?).

But this cannot be since then we would embed $G$ into $S_7$, which is impossible since $|G| \nmid 7 !=\left|S_7\right|$ (why?)
