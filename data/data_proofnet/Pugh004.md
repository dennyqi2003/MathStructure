Exercise 2.32a Show that every subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is clopen.
Proof.
32. The one-point set $\{n\} \subset \mathbb{N}$ is open, since it contains all $m \in \mathbb{N}$ that satisfy $d(m, n)<\frac{1}{2}$. Every subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is a union of one-point sets, hence is open. Then every set it closed, since its complement is necessarily open.
