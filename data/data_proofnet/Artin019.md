Exercise 10.7.10 Let $R$ be a ring, with $M$ an ideal of $R$. Suppose that every element of $R$ which is not in $M$ is a unit of $R$. Prove that $M$ is a maximal ideal and that moreover it is the only maximal ideal of $R$.
Proof.
Suppose there is an ideal $M\subset I\subset R$. If $I\neq M$, then $I$ contains a unit, thus $I=R$. Therefore $M$ is a maximal ideal. 

Suppose we have an arbitrary maximal ideal $M^\prime$ of $R$. The ideal $M^\prime$ cannot contain a unit, otherwise $M^\prime =R$. Therefore $M^\prime \subset M$. But we cannot have $M^\prime \subsetneq M \subsetneq R$, therefore $M=M^\prime$.
