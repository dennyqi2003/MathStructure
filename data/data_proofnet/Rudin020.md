Exercise 2.27b Suppose $E\subset\mathbb{R}^k$ is uncountable, and let $P$ be the set of condensation points of $E$. Prove that at most countably many points of $E$ are not in $P$.
Proof.
If $x \in W^c$, and $O$ is any neighborhood of $x$, then $x \in V_n \subseteq O$ for some n. Since $x \notin W, V_n \cap E$ is uncountable. Hence $O$ contains uncountably many points of $E$, and so $x$ is a condensation point of $E$. Thus $x \in P$, i.e., $W^c \subseteq P$.
Conversely if $x \in W$, then $x \in V_n$ for some $V_n$ such that $V_n \cap E$ is countable. Hence $x$ has a neighborhood (any neighborhood contained in $V_n$ ) containing at most a countable set of points of $E$, and so $x \notin P$, i.e., $W \subseteq P^c$. Hence $P=W^c$.
It is clear that $P$ is closed (since its complement $W$ is open), so that we need only show that $P \subseteq P^{\prime}$. Hence suppose $x \in P$, and $O$ is any neighborhood of $x$. (By definition of $P$ this means $O \cap E$ is uncountable.) We need to show that there is a point $y \in P \cap(O \backslash\{x\})$. If this is not the case, i.e., if every point $y$ in $O \backslash\{x\}$ is in $P^c$, then for each such point $y$ there is a set $V_n$ containing $y$ such that $V_n \cap E$ is at most countable. That would mean that $y \in W$, i.e., that $O \backslash\{x\}$ is contained in $W$. It would follow that $O \cap E \subseteq\{x\} \cup(W \cap E)$, and so $O \cap E$ contains at most a countable set of points, contrary to the hypothesis that $x \in P$. Hence $O$ contains a point of $P$ different from $x$, and so $P \subseteq P^{\prime}$. Thus $P$ is perfect.
