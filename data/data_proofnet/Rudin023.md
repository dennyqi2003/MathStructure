Exercise 3.1a Prove that convergence of $\left\{s_{n}\right\}$ implies convergence of $\left\{\left|s_{n}\right|\right\}$.
Proof.
Let $\varepsilon>0$. Since the sequence $\left\{s_n\right\}$ is a Cauchy sequence, there exists $N$ such that $\left|s_m-s_n\right|<\varepsilon$ for all $m>N$ and $n>N$. We then have $\left| |s_m| - |s_n| \right| \leq\left|s_m-s_n\right|<\varepsilon$ for all $m>N$ and $n>N$. Hence the sequence $\left\{\left|s_n\right|\right\}$ is also a Cauchy sequence, and therefore must converge.
