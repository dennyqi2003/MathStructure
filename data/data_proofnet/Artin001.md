Exercise 2.2.9 Let $H$ be the subgroup generated by two elements $a, b$ of a group $G$. Prove that if $a b=b a$, then $H$ is an abelian group.
Proof.
Since $a$ and $b$ commute, for any $g, h\in H$ we can write $g=a^ib^j$ and $h = a^kb^l$. Then $gh = a^ib^ja^kb^l = a^kb^la^ib^j = hg$. Thus $H$ is abelian.
