Exercise 9.4.2b Prove that $x^6+30x^5-15x^3 + 6x-120$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$.
Proof.
$$
x^6+30 x^5-15 x^3+6 x-120
$$
The coefficients of the low order.: $30,-15,0,6,-120$
They are divisible by the prime 3 , but $3^2=9$ doesn 't divide $-120$. So this polynomial is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}$.
