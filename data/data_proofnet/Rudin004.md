Exercise 1.4 Let $E$ be a nonempty subset of an ordered set; suppose $\alpha$ is a lower bound of $E$ and $\beta$ is an upper bound of $E$. Prove that $\alpha \leq \beta$.
Proof.
Since $E$ is nonempty, there exists $x \in E$. Then by definition of lower and upper bounds we have $\alpha \leq x \leq \beta$, and hence by property $i i$ in the definition of an ordering, we have $\alpha<\beta$ unless $\alpha=x=\beta$.
