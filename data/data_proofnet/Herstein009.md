Exercise 2.3.16 If a group $G$ has no proper subgroups, prove that $G$ is cyclic of order $p$, where $p$ is a prime number.
Proof.
Case-1: $G=(e), e$ being the identity element in $G$. Then trivially $G$ is cyclic.
    Case-2: $G \neq(e)$. Then there exists an non-identity element in $G.$ Let us consider an non-identity element in $G$, say $a\neq (e)$. Now look at the cyclic subgroup generated by $a$, that is, $\langle a\rangle$. Since
    $a\neq (e) \in G,\langle a\rangle$ is a subgroup of $G$.
If $G \neq\langle a\rangle$ then $\langle a\rangle$ is a proper non-trivial subgroup of $G$, which is an impossibility. Therfore we must have
$$
G=\langle a\rangle .
$$
This implies, $G$ is a cyclic group generated by $a$. Then it follows that every non-identity element of $G$ is a generator of $G$. Now we claim that $G$ is finite.
