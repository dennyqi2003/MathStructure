Exercise 3.6a Prove that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i<n} a_i = \infty$, where $a_i = \sqrt{i + 1} -\sqrt{i}$.
Proof.
(a) Multiplying and dividing $a_n$ by $\sqrt{n+1}+\sqrt{n}$, we find that $a_n=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n+1}+\sqrt{n}}$, which is larger than $\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{n+1}}$. The series $\sum a_n$ therefore diverges by comparison with the $p$ series $\left(p=\frac{1}{2}\right)$.
