Exercise 4.5.15 Prove that a group of order 351 has a normal Sylow $p$-subgroup for some prime $p$ dividing its order.
Proof.
Since $|G|=351=3^{2}.13$, $G$ has $3-$Sylow subgroup of order $9$, as well as $13-$Sylow subgroup of order $13$. Now, we count the number of such subgroups. Let $n_{13}$ be the number of $13-$Sylow subgroup and $n_{3}$ be the number of  $3-$Sylow subgroup. Now $n_{13}=1+13k$ where $1+13k|9$. The choices for $k$ is $0$. Hence, there is a unique $13-$Sylow subgroup and hence is normal.
