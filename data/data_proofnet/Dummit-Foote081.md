Exercise 9.4.2a Prove that $x^4-4x^3+6$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$.
Proof.
$$
x^4-4 x^3+6
$$
The polynomial is irreducible by Eisenstiens Criterion since the prime $2$ doesnt divide the leading coefficient 2 divide coefficients of the low order term $-4,0,0$ but 6 is not divided by the square of 2.
