Exercise 13.8b Show that the collection $\{(a,b) \mid a < b, a \text{ and } b \text{ rational}\}$ is a basis that generates a topology different from the lower limit topology on $\mathbb{R}$.
Proof.
(b) $\mathcal{C}$ is a basis for a topology on $\mathbb{R}$ since the union of its elements is $\mathbb{R}$ and the intersection of two elements of $\mathcal{C}$ is either empty or another element of $\mathcal{C}$. Now consider $[r, s)$ where $r$ is any irrational number and $s$ is any real number greater than $r$. Then $[r, s)$ is a basis element for the topology of $\mathbb{R}_{\ell}$, but $[r, s)$ is not a union of elements of $\mathcal{C}$. Indeed, suppose that $[r, s)=\cup_\alpha\left[a_\alpha, b_\alpha\right)$ for rationals $a_\alpha, b_\alpha$. Then $r \in\left[a_\alpha, b_\alpha\right)$ for some $\alpha$. Since $r$ is irrational we must have $a_\alpha<r$, but then $a_\alpha \notin[r, s)$, a contradiction. It follows that the topology generated by $\mathcal{C}$ is strictly coarser than the lower limit topology on $\mathbb{R}$.
