Exercise 4.5.21 Prove that if $|G|=2907$ then $G$ is not simple.
Proof.
Since $|G|=2907=3^{2}.17.19$, $G$ has $19-$Sylow subgroup of order $19$. Now, we count the number of such subgroups. Let $n_{19}$ be the number of $19-$Sylow subgroup. Now $n_{19}=1+19k$ where $1+19k|3^{2}.17$. The choices for $k$ is $0$. Hence, there is a unique $19-$Sylow subgroup and hence is normal. so $G$ is not simple.
