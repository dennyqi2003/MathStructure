Exercise 5.3 Suppose $g$ is a real function on $R^{1}$, with bounded derivative (say $\left|g^{\prime}\right| \leq M$ ). Fix $\varepsilon>0$, and define $f(x)=x+\varepsilon g(x)$. Prove that $f$ is one-to-one if $\varepsilon$ is small enough.
Proof.
If $0<\varepsilon<\frac{1}{M}$, we certainly have
$$
f^{\prime}(x) \geq 1-\varepsilon M>0,
$$
and this implies that $f(x)$ is one-to-one, by the preceding problem.
