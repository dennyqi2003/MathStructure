Exercise 28.5 Show that X is countably compact if and only if every nested sequence $C_1 \supset C_2 \supset \cdots$ of closed nonempty sets of X has a nonempty intersection.
Proof.
We could imitate the proof of Theorem 26.9, but we prove directly each direction. First let $X$ be countable compact and let $C_1 \supset C_2 \supset \cdots$ be a nested sequence of closed nonempty sets of $X$. For each $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}, U_n=X \backslash C_n$ is open in $X$. Then $\left\{U_n\right\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}}$is a countable collection of open sets with no finite subcollection covering $X$, for if $U_{i_1} \cup \cdots \cup U_{1_n}$ covers $X$, then $C_{i_1} \cap \cdots \cap C_{i_n}$ is empty, contrary to the assumption. Hence $\left\{U_n\right\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}}$does not cover $X$, so there exist $x \in X \backslash \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}} U_n=\bigcap_{n \in Z_{+}}\left(X \backslash U_n\right)=\bigcap_{n \in Z_{+}} C_n$.

Conversely, assume that every nested sequence $C_1 \supset C_2 \supset \cdots$ of closed non-empty sets of $X$ has a non-empty intersection and let $\left\{U_n\right\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}}$be a countable open covering of $X$. For each $n$, let $V_n=U_1 \cup \cdots \cup U_n$ and $C_n=X \backslash V_n$. Suppose that no finite subcollection of $\left\{U_n\right\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}}$covers $X$. Then each $C_n$ is non-empty, so $C_1 \supset C_2 \supset \cdots$ is a nested sequence of non-empty closed sets and $\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}} C_n$ is non-empty by assumption. Then there exists $x \in \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}} C_n$, so that $x \notin V_n$ for all $n$, contradicting the fact that $\left\{U_n\right\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}}$covers $X$. It follows that there exists $N \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}$such that $C_N=\emptyset$, so that $X=V_N$ and hence some finite subcollection of $\left\{U_n\right\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}}$covers $X$. We deduce that $X$ is countable compact.
