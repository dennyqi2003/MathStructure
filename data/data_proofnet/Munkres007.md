Exercise 13.5a Show that if $\mathcal{A}$ is a basis for a topology on $X$, then the topology generated by $\mathcal{A}$ equals the intersection of all topologies on $X$ that contain $\mathcal{A}$.
Proof.
Let $\mathcal{T}$ be the topology generated by $\mathcal{A}$ and let $\mathcal{O}$ be the intersection of all topologies on $X$ that contains $\mathcal{A}$. Clearly $\mathcal{O} \subset \mathcal{T}$ since $\mathcal{T}$ is a topology on $X$ that contain $\mathcal{A}$. Conversely, let $U \in \mathcal{T}$, so that $U$ is a union of elements of $\mathcal{A}$. Since each of this elements is also an element of $\mathcal{O}$, their union $U$ belongs to $\mathcal{O}$. Thus $\mathcal{T} \subset \mathcal{O}$ and the equality holds.
