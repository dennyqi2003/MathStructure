Exercise 5.3.10 Prove that $\cos 1^{\circ}$  is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$.
Proof.
Since $\left(\cos \left(1^{\circ}\right)+i \sin \left(1^{\circ}\right)\right)^{360}=1$, the number $\cos \left(1^{\circ}\right)+i \sin \left(1^{\circ}\right)$ is algebraic. And the real part and the imaginary part of an algebraic number are always algebraic numbers.
