Exercise 4.6.3 Show that there is an infinite number of integers a such that $f(x) = x^7 + 15x^2 - 30x + a$ is irreducible in $Q[x]$.
Proof.
Via Eisenstein's criterion and observation that 5 divides 15 and $-30$, it is sufficient to find infinitely many $a$ such that 5 divides $a$, but $5^2=25$ doesn't divide $a$. For example $5 \cdot 2^k$ for $k=0,1, \ldots$ is one such infinite sequence.
