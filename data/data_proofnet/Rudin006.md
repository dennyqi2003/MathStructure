Exercise 1.8 Prove that no order can be defined in the complex field that turns it into an ordered field.
Proof.
By Part (a) of Proposition $1.18$, either $i$ or $-i$ must be positive. Hence $-1=i^2=(-i)^2$ must be positive. But then $1=(-1)^2$, must also be positive, and this contradicts Part $(a)$ of Proposition 1.18, since 1 and $-1$ cannot both be positive.
