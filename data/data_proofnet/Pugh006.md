Exercise 2.46 Assume that $A, B$ are compact, disjoint, nonempty subsets of $M$. Prove that there are $a_0 \in A$ and $b_0 \in B$ such that for all $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ we have $d(a_0, b_0) \leq d(a, b)$.
Proof.
Let $A$ and $B$ be compact, disjoint and non-empty subsets of $M$. We want to show that there exist $a_0 \in A, b_0 \in B$ such that for all $a \in A, b \in B$,
$$
d\left(a_0, b_0\right) \leq d(a, b) .
$$
We saw in class that the distance function $d: M \times M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous. We also saw in class that any continuous, real-valued function assumes maximum and minimum values on a compact set. Since $A$ and $B$ are compact, $A \times B$ is (non-empty) compact in $M \times M$. Therefore there exists $\left(a_0, b_0\right) \in A \times B$ such that $d\left(a_0, b_0\right) \leq d(a, b), \forall(a, b) \in A \times B$.
