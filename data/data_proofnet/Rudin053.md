Exercise 5.4 If $C_{0}+\frac{C_{1}}{2}+\cdots+\frac{C_{n-1}}{n}+\frac{C_{n}}{n+1}=0,$ where $C_{0}, \ldots, C_{n}$ are real constants, prove that the equation $C_{0}+C_{1} x+\cdots+C_{n-1} x^{n-1}+C_{n} x^{n}=0$ has at least one real root between 0 and 1.
Proof.
Consider the polynomial
$$
p(x)=C_0 x+\frac{C_1}{2} x^2+\cdots+\frac{C_{n-1}}{n} x^n+\frac{C_n}{n+1} x^{n+1},
$$
whose derivative is
$$
p^{\prime}(x)=C_0+C_1 x+\cdots+C_{n-1} x^{n-1}+C_n x^n .
$$
It is obvious that $p(0)=0$, and the hypothesis of the problem is that $p(1)=0$. Hence Rolle's theorem implies that $p^{\prime}(x)=0$ for some $x$ between 0 and 1 .
