Exercise 13.4b1 Let $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$ be a family of topologies on $X$. Show that there is a unique smallest topology on $X$ containing all the collections $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$.
Proof.
(b) First we prove that there is a unique smallest topology on $X$ containing all the collections $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$. Uniqueness of such topology is clear. For each $\alpha$ let $\mathcal{B}_\alpha$ be a basis for $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$. Let $\mathcal{T}$ be the topology generated by the subbasis $\mathcal{S}=\bigcup_\alpha \mathcal{B}_\alpha$. Then the collection $\mathcal{B}$ of all finite intersections of elements of $\mathcal{S}$ is a basis for $\mathcal{T}$. Clearly $\mathcal{T}_\alpha \subset \mathcal{T}$ for all $\alpha$. We now prove that if $\mathcal{O}$ is a topology on $X$ such that $\mathcal{T}_\alpha \subset \mathcal{O}$ for all $\alpha$, then $\mathcal{T} \subset \mathcal{O}$. Given such $\mathcal{O}$, we have $\mathcal{B}_\alpha \subset \mathcal{O}$ for all $\alpha$, so $\mathcal{S} \subset \mathcal{O}$. Since $\mathcal{O}$ is a topology, it must contain all finite intersections of elements of $\mathcal{S}$, so $\mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{O}$ and hence $\mathcal{T} \subset \mathcal{O}$. We conclude that the topology $\mathcal{T}$ generated by the subbasis $\mathcal{S}=\cup_\alpha \mathcal{B}_\alpha$ is the unique smallest topology on $X$ containing all the collections $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$.
