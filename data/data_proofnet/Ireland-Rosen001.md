Exercise 1.27 For all odd $n$ show that $8 \mid n^{2}-1$.
Proof.
We have $n^2-1=(n+1)(n-1)$. Since $n$ is odd, both $n+1, n-1$ are even, and moreso, one of these must be divisible by 4 , as one of the two consecutive odd numbers is divisible by 4 . Thus, their product is divisible by 8 . Similarly, if 3 does not divide $n$, it must divide one of $n-1, n+1$, otherwise it wouldn't divide three consecutive integers, which is impossible. As $n$ is odd, $n+1$ is even, so $(n+1)(n-1)$ is divisible by both 2 and 3 , so it is divisible by 6 .
