Exercise 6.4.3 Prove that no group of order $p^2 q$, where $p$ and $q$ are prime, is simple.
Proof.
We may as well assume $p<q$. The number of Sylow $q$-subgroups is $1 \bmod q$ and divides $p^2$. So it is $1, p$, or $p^2$. We win if it's 1 and it can't be $p$, so suppose it's $p^2$. But now $q \mid p^2-1$, so $q \mid p+1$ or $q \mid p-1$.
Thus $p=2$ and $q=3$. But we know no group of order 36 is simple.
