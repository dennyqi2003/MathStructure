Exercise 3.2.21a Prove that $\mathbb{Q}$ has no proper subgroups of finite index.
Proof.
Solution: We begin with a lemma.
Lemma: If $D$ is a divisible abelian group, then no proper subgroup of $D$ has finite index.
Proof: We saw previously that no finite group is divisible and that every proper quotient $D / A$ of a divisible group is divisible; thus no proper quotient of a divisible group is finite. Equivalently, $[D: A]$ is not finite.
Because $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Q} / \mathbb{Z}$ are divisible, the conclusion follows.
