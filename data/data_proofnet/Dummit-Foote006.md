Exercise 1.1.16 Let $x$ be an element of $G$. Prove that $x^2=1$ if and only if $|x|$ is either $1$ or $2$.
Proof.
$(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $x^2=1$. Then we have $0<|x| \leq 2$, i.e., $|x|$ is either 1 or 2 .
( $\Leftarrow$ ) If $|x|=1$, then we have $x=1$ so that $x^2=1$. If $|x|=2$ then $x^2=1$ by definition. So if $|x|$ is 1 or 2 , we have $x^2=1$.
