Exercise 23.4 Show that if $X$ is an infinite set, it is connected in the finite complement topology.
Proof.
Suppose that $A$ is a non-empty subset of $X$ that is both open and closed, i.e., $A$ and $X \backslash A$ are finite or all of $X$. Since $A$ is non-empty, $X \backslash A$ is finite. Thus $A$ cannot be finite as $X \backslash A$ is infinite, so $A$ is all of $X$. Therefore $X$ is connected.
