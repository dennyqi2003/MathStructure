Exercise 4.4.7 If $H$ is the unique subgroup of a given order in a group $G$ prove $H$ is characteristic in $G$.
Proof.
Let $G$ be group and $H$ be the unique subgroup of order $n$. Now, let $\sigma \in \operatorname{Aut}(G)$. Now Clearly $|\sigma(G)|=n$, because $\sigma$ is a one-one onto map. But then as $H$ is the only subgroup of order $n$, and because of the fact that a automorphism maps subgroups to subgroups, we have $\sigma(H)=$ $H$ for every $\sigma \in \operatorname{Aut}(G)$. Hence, $H$ is a characterestic subgroup of $G$.
