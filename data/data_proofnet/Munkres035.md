Exercise 25.4 Let $X$ be locally path connected. Show that every connected open set in $X$ is path connected.
Proof.
Let $U$ be a open connected set in $X$. By Theorem 25.4, each path component of $U$ is open in $X$, hence open in $U$. Thus, each path component in $U$ is both open and closed in $U$, so must be empty or all of $U$. It follows that $U$ is path-connected.
