Exercise 13.8a Show that the collection $\{(a,b) \mid a < b, a \text{ and } b \text{ rational}\}$ is a basis that generates the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$.
Proof.
Exercise 13.8. (a) First note that $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for a topology on $\mathbb{R}$. This follows from the fact that the union of its elements is all of $\mathbb{R}$ and the intersection of two elements of $\mathcal{B}$ is either empty or another element of $\mathcal{B}$. Let $\mathcal{T}$ be the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$. Clearly the topology generated by $\mathcal{B}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{T}$. Let $U \in \mathcal{T}$ and $x \in U$. Then $U$ contains an open interval with centre $x$. Since the rationals are dense in $\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology, there exists $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $x \in(x-q, x+q) \subset U$. This proves that $\mathcal{T}$ is coarser than the topology generated by $\mathcal{B}$. We conclude that $\mathcal{B}$ generates the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$.
