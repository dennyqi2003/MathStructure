Exercise 4.5.16 Let $|G|=p q r$, where $p, q$ and $r$ are primes with $p<q<r$. Prove that $G$ has a normal Sylow subgroup for either $p, q$ or $r$.
Proof.
Let $|G|=p q r$. We also assume $p<q<r$. We prove that $G$ has a normal Sylow subgroup of $p$, $q$ or $r$. Now, Let $n_p, n_q, n_r$ be the number of Sylow-p subgroup, Sylow-q subgroup, Sylow-r subgroup resp. So, we have $n_r=1+r k$ such that $1+r k \mid p q$. So, in this case as $r$ is greatest $n_r$ can be 1 or $p q$. We assume $n_r=p q$. Now we have $n_q=1+q k$ such that $1+q k \mid p r$. Now,as $p<q<r, n_q$ can be 1 or $r$, or $p r$. Assume that $n_q=r$. Now we turn to $n_p$. Again my similar method we can conclude $n_p$ can be $1, q, r$, or $q r$. We assume that $n_p$ is $q$. Now we count the number of elements of order $p, q, r$. Since $n_r=p q$, the number of elements of order $r$ is $p q(r-1)$. Since $n_q=r$, the number of elements of order $q$ is $(q-1) r$. And as $n_p=q$, the number of elements of order $p$ is $(p-1) q$. So, in total we get $p q(r-1)+(q-1) r+(p-$ 1) $q=p q r+q r-r-q=p q r+r(q-1)-r$. But observe that as $q>1, r(q-1)-r>$ 0 . So the number of elements exceeds $p q r$. So, it proves that atleast $n_p$ or $n_q$ or $n_r$ is 1, which ultimately proves the result, because a unique Sylow-p subgroup is always normal.
