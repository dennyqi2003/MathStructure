Exercise 4.4.6b Prove that there exists a normal subgroup that is not characteristic.
Proof.
We have to produce a group $G$ and a subgroup $H$ such that $H$ is normal in $G$, but not characterestic. Consider the Klein's four group $G=\{ e, a, b, a b\}$. This is an abelian group with each element having order 2. Consider $H=\{ e, a\}$. $H$ is normal in $G$. Define $\sigma: G \rightarrow G$ as $\sigma(a)=b, \sigma(b)=a, \sigma(a b)=a b$. Clearly $\sigma$ does not fix $H$. So, $H$ is not characterestic.
