Exercise 2.1.5 Prove that $G$ cannot have a subgroup $H$ with $|H|=n-1$, where $n=|G|>2$.
Proof.
Solution: Under these conditions, there exists a nonidentity element $x \in H$ and an element $y \notin H$. Consider the product $x y$. If $x y \in H$, then since $x^{-1} \in H$ and $H$ is a subgroup, $y \in H$, a contradiction. If $x y \notin H$, then we have $x y=y$. Thus $x=1$, a contradiction. Thus no such subgroup exists.
