Exercise 1.19 Suppose $a, b \in R^k$. Find $c \in R^k$ and $r > 0$ such that $|x-a|=2|x-b|$ if and only if $| x - c | = r$. Prove that $3c = 4b - a$ and $3r = 2 |b - a|$.
Proof.
Since the solution is given to us, all we have to do is verify it, i.e., we need to show that the equation
$$
|\mathrm{x}-\mathrm{a}|=2|\mathrm{x}-\mathrm{b}|
$$
is equivalent to $|\mathrm{x}-\mathbf{c}|=r$, which says
$$
\left|\mathbf{x}-\frac{4}{3} \mathbf{b}+\frac{1}{3} \mathbf{a}\right|=\frac{2}{3}|\mathbf{b}-\mathbf{a}| .
$$
If we square both sides of both equations, we an equivalent pair of equations, the first of which reduces to
$$
3|\mathbf{x}|^2+2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{x}-8 \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{x}-|\mathbf{a}|^2+4|\mathbf{b}|^2=0,
$$
and the second of which reduces to this equation divided by 3 . Hence these equations are indeed equivalent.
