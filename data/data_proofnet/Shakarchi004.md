Exercise 1.19a Prove that the power series $\sum nz^n$ does not converge on any point of the unit circle.
Proof.
For $z \in S:=\{z \in \mathbb{C}:|z|=1\}$ it also holds $z^n \in S$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ (since in this case $\left.\left|z^n\right|=|z|^n=1^n=1\right)$
Thus, the sequence $\left(a_n\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ with $a_n=n z^n$ does not converge to zero which is necessary for the corresponding sum $\sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} a_n$ to be convergent. Hence this sum does not converge.
