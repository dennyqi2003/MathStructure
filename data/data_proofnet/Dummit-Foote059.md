Exercise 4.5.23 Prove that if $|G|=462$ then $G$ is not simple.
Proof.
Let $G$ be a group of order $462=11 \cdot 42$. Note that 11 is a prime not dividing 42 . Let $P \in$ $S y l_{11}(G)$. [We know $P$ exists since $S y l_{11}(G) \neq \emptyset$]. Note that $|P|=11^1=11$ by definition. 

The number of Sylow 11-subgroups of $G$ is of the form $1+k \cdot 11$, i.e., $n_{11} \equiv 1$ (mod 11) and $n_{11}$ divides 42 . The only such number that divides 42 and equals 1 (mod 11) is 1 so $n_{11}=1$. Hence $P$ is the unique Sylow 11-subgroup.

Since $P$ is the unique Sylow Il-subgroup, this implies that $P$ is normal in $G$.
