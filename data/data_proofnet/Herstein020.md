Exercise 2.8.12 Prove that any two nonabelian groups of order 21 are isomorphic.
Proof.
By Cauchy's theorem we have that if $G$ is a group of order 21 then it has an element $a$ of order 3 and an element $b$ of order 7. By exercise 2.5.41 we have that the subgroup generated by $b$ is normal, so there is some $i=0,1,2,3,4,5,6$ such that $a b a^{-1}=b^i$. We know $i \neq$ 0 since that implies $a b=a$ and so that $b=e$, a contradiction, and we know $i \neq 1$ since then $a b=b a$ and this would imply $G$ is abelian, which we are assuming is not the case.
Now, $a$ has order 3 so we must have $b=a^3 b a^{-3}=b^{i^3}$ mod 7 , and so $i$ is restricted by the modular equation $i^3 \equiv 1 \bmod 7$
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline$x$ & $x^3 \bmod 7$ \\
\hline 2 & 1 \\
\hline 3 & 6 \\
\hline 4 & 1 \\
\hline 5 & 6 \\
\hline 6 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Therefore the only options are $i=2$ and $i=4$. Now suppose $G$ is such that $a b a^{-1}=b^2$ and let $G^{\prime}$ be another group of order 21 with an element $c$ of order 3 and an element $d$ of order 7 such that $c d c^{-1}=d^4$. We now prove that $G$ and $G^{\prime}$ are isomorphic. Define
$$
\begin{aligned}
\phi: G & \rightarrow G^{\prime} \\
a & \mapsto c^{-1} \\
b & \mapsto d
\end{aligned}
$$
since $a$ and $c^{-1}$ have the same order and $b$ and $d$ have the same order this is a well defined function. Since
$$
\begin{aligned}
\phi(a) \phi(b) \phi(a)^{-1} & =c^{-1} d c \\
& =\left(c d^{-1} c^{-1}\right)^{-1} \\
& =\left(d^{-4}\right)^{-1} \\
& =d^4 \\
& =\left(d^2\right)^2 \\
& =\phi(b)^2
\end{aligned}
$$
$\phi$ is actually a homomorphism. For any $c^i d^j \in G^{\prime}$ we have $\phi\left(a^{-i} b^j\right)=c^i d^j$ so $\phi$ is onto and $\phi\left(a^i b^j\right)=c^{-i} d^j=e$ only if $i=j=0$, so $\phi$ is 1-to-l. Therefore $G$ and $G^{\prime}$ are isomorphic and so up to isomorphism there is only one nonabelian group of order 21 .
