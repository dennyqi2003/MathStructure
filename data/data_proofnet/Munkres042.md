Exercise 28.6 Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. If $f: X \rightarrow X$ satisfies the condition $d(f(x), f(y))=d(x, y)$ for all $x, y \in X$, then $f$ is called an isometry of $X$. Show that if $f$ is an isometry and $X$ is compact, then $f$ is bijective and hence a homeomorphism.
Proof.
Note that $f$ is an imbedding. It remains to prove that $f$ is surjective. Suppose it is not, and let $a \in f(X)$. Since $X$ is compact, $f(X)$ is compact and hence closed (every metric space is Hausdorff). Thus, there exists $\varepsilon>0$ such that the $\varepsilon^{-}$ neighbourhood of $a$ is contained in $X \backslash f(X)$. Set $x_1=a$, and inductively $x_{n+1}=f\left(x_n\right)$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}$. We show that $d\left(x_n, x_m\right) \geq \varepsilon$ for $n \neq m$. Indeed, we may assume $n<m$. If $n \geq 1$, then $d\left(x_n, x_m\right)=$ $d\left(f^{-1}\left(x_n\right), f^{-1}\left(x_m\right)\right)=d\left(x_{n-1}, x_{m-1}\right)$. By induction it follows that $d\left(x_n, x_m\right)=d\left(x_{n-i}, x_{m-i}\right)$ for all $i \geq 1$, and hence $d\left(x_n, x_m\right)=d\left(a, x_{m-n}\right)=d\left(a, f\left(x_{m-n-1}\right)\right)$. Since $f\left(x_{m-n-1}\right) \in f(X)$ and $B(a, \varepsilon) \cap f(X)=\emptyset$, we have $d\left(x_n, x_m\right) \geq \varepsilon$, as claimed. Thus $\left\{x_n\right\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}}$is a sequence with no convergent subsequence, so $X$ is not sequentially compact. This contradicts the fact that $X$ is compact. Therefore $f$ is surjective and hence a homeomorphism.
