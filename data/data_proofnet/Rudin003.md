Exercise 1.2 Prove that there is no rational number whose square is $12$.
Proof.
Suppose $m^2=12 n^2$, where $m$ and $n$ have no common factor. It follows that $m$ must be even, and therefore $n$ must be odd. Let $m=2 r$. Then we have $r^2=3 n^2$, so that $r$ is also odd. Let $r=2 s+1$ and $n=2 t+1$. Then
$$
4 s^2+4 s+1=3\left(4 t^2+4 t+1\right)=12 t^2+12 t+3,
$$
so that
$$
4\left(s^2+s-3 t^2-3 t\right)=2 .
$$
But this is absurd, since 2 cannot be a multiple of 4 .
