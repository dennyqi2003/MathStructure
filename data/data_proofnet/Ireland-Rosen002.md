Exercise 1.30 Prove that $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}$ is not an integer.
Proof.
Let $2^s$ be the largest power of 2 occuring as a denominator in $H_n$, say $2^s=k \leqslant n$. Write $H_n=$ $\frac{1}{2^s}+\left(1+1 / 2+\ldots+1 /(k-1)+1 /(k+1)+\ldots+1 / n\right.$. The sum in parentheses can be written as $1 / 2^{s-1}$ times sum of fractions with odd denominators, so the denominator of the sum in parentheses will not be divisible by $2^s$, but it must equal $2^s$ by Ex $1.29$.
