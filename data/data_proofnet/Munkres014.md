Exercise 16.6 Show that the countable collection \[\{(a, b) \times (c, d) \mid a < b \text{ and } c < d, \text{ and } a, b, c, d \text{ are rational}\}\] is a basis for $\mathbb{R}^2$.
Proof.
We know that $\mathcal{B}=\{(a,b)|a<b, a \text{ and } b \text rational\}$ is a basis for $\mathcal{R}$, therefore the set we are concerned with in the above question is a basis for $\mathcal{R}^2$.
