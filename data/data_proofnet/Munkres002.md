Exercise 13.3b Show that the collection $$\mathcal{T}_\infty = \{U | X - U \text{ is infinite or empty or all of X}\}$$ does not need to be a topology on the set $X$.
Proof.
Let $X=\mathbb{R}, U_1=(-\infty, 0)$ and $U_2=(0, \infty)$. Then $U_1$ and $U_2$ are in $\mathcal{T}_{\infty}$ but $U_1 \cup U_2=\mathbb{R} \backslash\{0\}$ is not.
