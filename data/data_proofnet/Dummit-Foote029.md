Exercise 3.2.8 Prove that if $H$ and $K$ are finite subgroups of $G$ whose orders are relatively prime then $H \cap K=1$.
Proof.
Solution: Let $|H|=p$ and $|K|=q$. We saw in a previous exercise that $H \cap K$ is a subgroup of both $H$ and $K$; by Lagrange's Theorem, then, $|H \cap K|$ divides $p$ and $q$. Since $\operatorname{gcd}(p, q)=1$, then, $|H \cap K|=1$. Thus $H \cap K=1$.
