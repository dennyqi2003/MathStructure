Exercise 4.5.13 Prove that a group of order 56 has a normal Sylow $p$-subgroup for some prime $p$ dividing its order.
Proof.
Since $|G|=56=2^{3}.7$, $G$ has $2-$Sylow subgroup of order $8$, as well as $7-$Sylow subgroup of order $7$. Now, we count the number of such subgroups. Let $n_{7}$ be the number of  $7-$Sylow subgroup and $n_{2}$ be the number of  $2-$Sylow subgroup. Now $n_{7}=1+7k$ where $1+7k|8$. The choices for $k$ are $0$ or $1$. If $k=0$, there is only one $7-$Sylow subgroup and hence normal. So, assume now, that there are $8$ $7-$Sylow subgroup(for $k=1$). Now we look at $2-$ Sylow subgroups. $n_{2}=1+2k| 7$. So choice for $k$ are $0$ and $3$. If $k=0$, there is only one $2-$Sylow subgroup and hence normal. So, assume now, that there are $7$ $2-$Sylow subgroup (for $k=3$). Now we claim that simultaneously, there cannot be $8$ $7-$Sylow subgroup and $7$ $2-$Sylow subgroup. So, either $7-$Sylow subgroup is normal being unique, or  the $2-$Sylow subgroup is normal. Now, to prove the claim, we observe that there are 48 elements of order $7$. Let $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ be two distinct  $2-$Sylow subgroup. Now $|H_{1}|=8$. So we already get $48+8=56$ distinct elements in the group. Now $H_{2}$ being distinct from $H_{1}$, has at least one element which is not in $H_{1}$. This adds one more element in the group, at the least. Now already we have number of elements in the group exceeding the number of element in $G$. This gives a contradiction and proves the claim.
