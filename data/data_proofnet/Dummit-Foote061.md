Exercise 4.5.33 Let $P$ be a normal Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ and let $H$ be any subgroup of $G$. Prove that $P \cap H$ is the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$.
Proof.
Let $G$ be a group and $P$ is a normal $p$-Sylow subgroup of $G .|G|=p^a . m$ where $p \nmid m$. Then $|P|=p^a$. Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Now if $|H|=k$ such that $p \nmid k$. Then $P \cap H=\{e\}$. There is nothing to prove in this case. Let $|H|=p^b . n$, where $b \leq a$, and $p \nmid n$. Now consider $P H$ which is a subgroup of $G$, as $P$ is normal. Now $|P H|=\frac{|P||H|}{|P \cap H|}=\frac{p^{a+b} \cdot n}{|P \cap H|}$. Now since $P H \leq G$, so $|P H|=p^a$.l, as $P \leq P H$. This forces $|P \cap H|=p^b$. So by order consideration we have $P \cap H$ is a sylow $-p$ subgroup of $H$. Now we know $P$ is unique $p$ - Sylow subgroup. Suppose $H$ has a sylow-p subgroup distinct from $P \cap H$, call it $H_1$. Now $H_1$ is a p-subgroup of $G$. So, $H_1$ is contained in some Sylow-p subgroup of $G$, call it $P_1$. Clearly $P_1$ is distinct from $P$, which is a contradiction. So $P \cap H$ is the only $p$-Sylow subgroup of $H$, and hence normal in $H$
