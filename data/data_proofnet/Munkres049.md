Exercise 31.2 Show that if $X$ is normal, every pair of disjoint closed sets have neighborhoods whose closures are disjoint.
Proof.
Let $A$ and $B$ be disjoint closed sets. Then there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ containing $A$ and $B$ respectively.

Since $X \backslash V$ is closed and contains $U$, the closure of $U$ is contained in $X \backslash V$ hence $B$ and closure of $U$ are disjoint.

Repeat steps 1 and 2 for $B$ and $\bar{U}$ instead of $A$ and $B$ respectively and you will have open set $V^{\prime}$ which contains $B$ and its closure doesn't intersect with $\bar{U}$.
Qed.
