Exercise 4.19 Suppose $f$ is a real function with domain $R^{1}$ which has the intermediate value property: if $f(a)<c<f(b)$, then $f(x)=c$ for some $x$ between $a$ and $b$. Suppose also, for every rational $r$, that the set of all $x$ with $f(x)=r$ is closed. Prove that $f$ is continuous.
Proof.
The contradiction is evidently that $x_0$ is a limit point of the set of $t$ such that $f(t)=r$, yet, $x_0$ does not belong to this set. This contradicts the hypothesis that the set is closed.
