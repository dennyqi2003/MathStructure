Exercise 2.11.7 If $P \triangleleft G$, $P$ a $p$-Sylow subgroup of $G$, prove that $\varphi(P) = P$ for every automorphism $\varphi$ of $G$.
Proof.
Let $\phi$ be an automorphism of $G$. Let $P$ be a normal sylow p-subgroup. $\phi(P)$ is also a sylow-p subgroup. But since $P$ is normal, it is unique. Hence $\phi(P)=P$.
