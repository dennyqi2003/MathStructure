Exercise 3.22 Suppose $X$ is a nonempty complete metric space, and $\left\{G_{n}\right\}$ is a sequence of dense open sets of $X$. Prove Baire's theorem, namely, that $\bigcap_{1}^{\infty} G_{n}$ is not empty.
Proof.
Let $F_n$ be the complement of $G_n$, so that $F_n$ is closed and contains no open sets. We shall prove that any nonempty open set $U$ contains a point not in any $F_n$, hence in all $G_n$. To this end, we note that $U$ is not contained in $F_1$, so that there is a point $x_1 \in U \backslash F_1$. Since $U \backslash F_1$ is open, there exists $r_1>0$ such that $B_1$, defined as the open ball of radius $r_1$ about $x_1$, is contained in $U \backslash F_1$. Let $E_1$ be the open ball of radius $\frac{r_1}{2}$ about $x_1$, so that the closure of $E_1$ is contained in $B_1$. Now $F_2$ does not contain $E_1$, and so we can find a point $x_2 \in E_1 \backslash F_2$. Since $E_1 \backslash F_2$ is an open set, there exists a positive number $r_2$ such that $B_2$, the open ball of radius $R_2$ about $x_2$, is contained in $E_1 \backslash F_2$, which in turn is contained in $U \backslash\left(F_1 \cup F_2\right)$. We let $E_2$ be the open ball of radius $\frac{r_2}{2}$ about $x_2$, so that $\bar{E}_2 \subseteq B_2$. Proceeding in this way, we construct a sequence of open balls $E_j$, such that $E_j \supseteq \bar{E}_{j+1}$, and the diameter of $E_j$ tends to zero. By the previous exercise, there is a point $x$ belonging to all the sets $\bar{E}_j$, hence to all the sets $U \backslash\left(F_1 \cup F_2 \cup \cdots \cup F_n\right)$. Thus the point $x$ belongs to $U \cap\left(\cap_1^{\infty} G_n\right)$.
