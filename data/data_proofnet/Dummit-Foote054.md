Exercise 4.5.18 Prove that a group of order 200 has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup.
Proof.
Let $G$ be a group of order $200=5^2 \cdot 8$. Note that 5 is a prime not dividing 8 . Let $P \in$ $S y l_5(G)$. [We know $P$ exists since $S y l_5(G) \neq \emptyset$ by Sylow's Theorem]

The number of Sylow 5-subgroups of $G$ is of the form $1+k \cdot 5$, i.e., $n_5 \equiv 1(\bmod 5)$ and $n_5$ divides 8 . The only such number that divides 8 and equals $1 (\bmod 5)$ is 1 so $n_5=1$. Hence $P$ is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup.
Since $P$ is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup, this implies that $P$ is normal in $G$.
