Exercise 25.9 Let $G$ be a topological group; let $C$ be the component of $G$ containing the identity element $e$. Show that $C$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
Proof.
Given $x \in G$, the maps $y \mapsto x y$ and $y \mapsto y x$ are homeomorphisms of $G$ onto itself. Since $C$ is a component, $x C$ and $C x$ are both components that contain $x$, so they are equal. Hence $x C=C x$ for all $x \in G$, so $C$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
