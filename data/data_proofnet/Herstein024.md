Exercise 2.11.6 If $P$ is a $p$-Sylow subgroup of $G$ and $P \triangleleft G$, prove that $P$ is the only $p$-Sylow subgroup of $G$.
Proof.
let $G$ be a group and $P$ a sylow-p subgroup. Given $P$ is normal. By sylow second theorem the sylow-p subgroups are conjugate. Let $K$ be any other sylow-p subgroup. Then there exists $g \in G$ such that $K=g P g^{-1}$. But since $P$ is normal $K=g P g^{-1}=P$. Hence the sylow-p subgroup is unique.
