Exercise 32.3 Show that every locally compact Hausdorff space is regular.
Proof.
Let $X$ be a LCH space.
Then it follows that for every $x \in X$ and for every open neighborhood $U \subseteq X$ of $x$ there exists an open neighborhood $V \subseteq X$ of $x$ such that $\bar{V} \subseteq U$ (and $\bar{V}$ is compact, but this is not important here).
Since $X$ is a Hausdorff space, it satisfies the $T_1$ axiom.
Then it follows that $X$ is regular.
