Exercise 19.6a Let $\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots$ be a sequence of the points of the product space $\prod X_\alpha$.  Show that this sequence converges to the point $\mathbf{x}$ if and only if the sequence $\pi_\alpha(\mathbf{x}_i)$ converges to $\pi_\alpha(\mathbf{x})$ for each $\alpha$.
Proof.
For each $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}$, we write $\mathbf{x}_n=\left(x_n^\alpha\right)_\alpha$, so that $\pi_\alpha\left(\mathbf{x}_n\right)=x_n^\alpha$ for each $\alpha$.
First assume that the sequence $\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots$ converges to $\mathbf{x}=\left(x_\alpha\right)_\alpha$ in the product space $\prod_\alpha X_\alpha$. Fix an index $\beta$ and let $U$ be a neighbourhood of $\pi_\beta(\mathbf{x})=x_\beta$. Let $V=\prod_\alpha U_\alpha$, where $U_\alpha=X_\alpha$ for each $\alpha \neq \beta$ and $U_\beta=U$. Then $V$ is a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{x}$, so there exists $N \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}$such that $\mathbf{x}_n \in V$ for all $n \geq N$. Therefore $\pi_\beta\left(\mathbf{x}_n\right)=x_n^\beta \in U$ for all $n \geq N$. Since $U$ was arbitrary, it follows that $\pi_\beta\left(\mathbf{x}_1\right), \pi_\beta\left(\mathbf{x}_2\right), \ldots$ converges to $\pi_\beta(\mathbf{x})$. Since $\beta$ was arbitrary, this holds for all indices $\alpha$.
