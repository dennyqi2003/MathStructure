Exercise 2000.a2 Prove that there exist infinitely many integers $n$ such that $n, n+1, n+2$ are each the sum of the squares of two integers.
Proof.
It is well-known that the equation $x^2-2y^2=1$ has infinitely
many solutions (the so-called ``Pell'' equation).  Thus setting
$n=2y^2$ (so that $n=y^2+y^2$, $n+1=x^2+0^2$, $n+2=x^2+1^2$)
yields infinitely many $n$ with the desired property.
