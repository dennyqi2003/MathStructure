Exercise 2.5.43 Prove that a group of order 9 must be abelian.
Proof.
We use the result from problem 40 which is as follows: Suppose $G$ is a group, $H$ is a subgroup and $|G|=n$ and $n \nmid\left(i_G(H)\right) !$. Then there exists a normal subgroup $\$ K \backslash$ neq $\{$ e $\} \$$ and $K \subseteq H$.
So, we have now a group $G$ of order 9. Suppose that $G$ is cyclic, then $G$ is abelian and there is nothing more to prove. Suppose that $G$ s not cyclic,then there exists an element $a$ of order 3 , and $A=\langle a\rangle$. Now $i_G(A)=3$, now $9 \nmid 3$ !, hence by the above result there is a normal subgroup $K$, non-trivial and $K \subseteq A$. But $|A|=3$, a prime order subgroup, hence has no non-trivial subgroup, so $K=A$. So $A$ is normal subgroup. Now since $G$ is not cyclic any non-identity element is of order 3.So Let $a(\neq$ $e) \in G$.Consider $A=\langle a\rangle$. As shown before $A$ is normal. $a$ commutes with any if its powers. Now Let $b \in G$ such that $b \notin A$. Then $b a b^{-1} \in A$ and hence $b a b^{-1}=a^i$.This implies $a=b^3 a b^{-3}=a^{i^3} \Longrightarrow a^{i^3-1}=e$. So, 3 divides $i^3-1$. Also by fermat's little theorem 3 divides $i^2-1$.So 3 divides $i-1$. But $0 \leq i \leq 2$. So $i=1$, is the only possibility and hence $a b=b a$. So $a \in Z(G)$ as $b$ was arbitrary. Since $a$ was arbitrary $G=Z(G)$. Hence $G$ is abelian.
