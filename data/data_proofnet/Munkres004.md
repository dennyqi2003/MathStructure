Exercise 13.4a2 If $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$ is a family of topologies on $X$, show that $\bigcup \mathcal{T}_\alpha$ does not need to be a topology on $X$.
Proof.
On the other hand, the union $\bigcup_\alpha \mathcal{T}_\alpha$ is in general not a topology on $X$. For instance, let $X=\{a, b, c\}$. Then $\mathcal{T}_1=\{\emptyset, X,\{a\}\}$ and $\mathcal{T}_2=\{\emptyset, X,\{b\}\}$ are topologies on $X$ but $\mathcal{T}_1 \cup \mathcal{T}_2=$ $\{\emptyset, X,\{a\},\{b\}\}$ is not.
