Exercise 4.4.9 Show that $(p - 1)/2$ of the numbers $1, 2, \ldots, p - 1$ are quadratic residues and $(p - 1)/2$ are quadratic nonresidues $\mod p$.
Proof.
To find all the quadratic residues $\bmod p$ among the integers $1,2, \ldots, p-1$, we compute the least positive residues modulo $p$ of the squares of the integers $1,2, \ldots, p-1\}$.

Since there are $p-1$ squares to consider, and since each congruence $x^2 \equiv a (\bmod p)$ has either zero or two solutions, there must be exactly $\frac{(p-1)}{2}$ quadratic residues mod $p$ among the integers $1,2, \ldots, p-1$.
The remaining
$$
(p-1)-\frac{(p-1)}{2}=\frac{(p-1)}{2}
$$
positive integers less than $p-1$ are quadratic non-residues of $\bmod p$.
