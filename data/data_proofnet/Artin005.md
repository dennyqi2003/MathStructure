Exercise 2.11.3 Prove that a group of even order contains an element of order $2 .$
Proof.
Pair up if possible each element of $G$ with its inverse, and observe that
$$
g^2 \neq e \Longleftrightarrow g \neq g^{-1} \Longleftrightarrow \text { there exists the pair }\left(g, g^{-1}\right)
$$
Now, there is one element that has no pairing: the unit $e$ (since indeed $e=e^{-1} \Longleftrightarrow e^2=e$ ), so since the number of elements of $G$ is even there must be at least one element more, say $e \neq a \in G$, without a pairing, and thus $a=a^{-1} \Longleftrightarrow a^2=e$
