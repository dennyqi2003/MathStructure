Exercise 22.5 Let $p \colon X \rightarrow Y$ be an open map. Show that if $A$ is open in $X$, then the map $q \colon A \rightarrow p(A)$ obtained by restricting $p$ is an open map.
Proof.
Let $U$ be open in $A$. Since $A$ is open in $X, U$ is open in $X$ as well, so $p(U)$ is open in $Y$. Since $q(U)=p(U)=p(U) \cap p(A)$, the set $q(U)$ is open in $p(A)$. Thus $q$ is an open map.
