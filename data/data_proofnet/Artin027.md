Exercise 13.4.10 Prove that if a prime integer $p$ has the form $2^r+1$, then it actually has the form $2^{2^k}+1$.
Proof.
In particular, we have
$$
\frac{x^a+1}{x+1}=\frac{(-x)^a-1}{(-x)-1}=1-x+x^2-\cdots+(-x)^{a-1}
$$
by the geometric sum formula. In this case, specialize to $x=2^{2^m}$ and we have a nontrivial divisor.
