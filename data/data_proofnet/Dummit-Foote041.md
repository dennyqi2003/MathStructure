Exercise 4.2.14 Let $G$ be a finite group of composite order $n$ with the property that $G$ has a subgroup of order $k$ for each positive integer $k$ dividing $n$. Prove that $G$ is not simple.
Proof.
Solution: Let $p$ be the smallest prime dividing $n$, and write $n=p m$. Now $G$ has a subgroup $H$ of order $m$, and $H$ has index $p$. Then $H$ is normal in $G$.
