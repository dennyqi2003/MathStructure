Exercise 4.4.6a Prove that characteristic subgroups are normal.
Proof.
Let $H$ be a characterestic subgroup of $G$. By definition $\alpha(H) \subset H$ for every $\alpha \in \operatorname{Aut}(G)$. So, $H$ is in particular invariant under the inner automorphism. Let $\phi_g$ denote the conjugation automorphism by $g$. Then $\phi_g(H) \subset H \Longrightarrow$ $g H g^{-1} \subset H$. So, $H$ is normal.
