Exercise 17.4 Show that if $U$ is open in $X$ and $A$ is closed in $X$, then $U-A$ is open in $X$, and $A-U$ is closed in $X$.
Proof.
Since
$$
X \backslash(U \backslash A)=(X \backslash U) \cup A \text { and } \quad X \backslash(A \backslash U)=(X \backslash A) \cup U,
$$
it follows that $X \backslash(U \backslash A)$ is closed in $X$ and $X \backslash(A \backslash U)$ is open in $X$.
