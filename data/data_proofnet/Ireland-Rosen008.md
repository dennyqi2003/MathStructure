Exercise 3.4 Show that the equation $3 x^{2}+2=y^{2}$ has no solution in integers.
Proof.
If $3x^2+2 = y^2$, then  $\overline{y}^2 = \overline{2}$ in $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$.


As $\{-1,0,1\}$ is a complete set of residues modulo $3$, the squares in $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ are $\overline{0} = \overline{0}^2$ and  $\overline{1} = \overline{1}^2 = (\overline{-1})^2$, so $\overline{2}$ is not a square in $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ : $\overline{y}^2 = \overline{2}$ is impossible in $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$.

Thus $3x^2+2 = y^2$ has no solution in integers.
