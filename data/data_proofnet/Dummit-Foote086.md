Exercise 9.4.11 Prove that $x^2+y^2-1$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$.
Proof.
$$
p(x)=x^2+y^2-1 \in Q[y][x] \cong Q[y, x]
$$
We have that $y+1 \in Q[y]$ is prime and $Q[y]$ is an UFD, since $p(x)=x^2+y^2-1=x^2+$ $(y+1)(y-1)$ by the Eisenstein criterion $x^2+y^2-1$ is irreducibile in $Q[x, y]$.
