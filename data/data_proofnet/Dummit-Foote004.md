Exercise 1.1.5 Prove that for all $n>1$ that $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is not a group under multiplication of residue classes.
Proof.
Note that since $n>1, \overline{1} \neq \overline{0}$. Now suppose $\mathbb{Z} /(n)$ contains a multiplicative identity element $\bar{e}$. Then in particular,
$$
\bar{e} \cdot \overline{1}=\overline{1}
$$
so that $\bar{e}=\overline{1}$. Note, however, that
$$
\overline{0} \cdot \bar{k}=\overline{0}
$$
for all k, so that $\overline{0}$ does not have a multiplicative inverse. Hence $\mathbb{Z} /(n)$ is not a group under multiplication.
