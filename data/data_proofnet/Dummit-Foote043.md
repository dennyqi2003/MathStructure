Exercise 4.4.2 Prove that if $G$ is an abelian group of order $p q$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes, then $G$ is cyclic.
Proof.
Let $G$ be an abelian group of order $p q$. We need to prove that if $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes than $G$ is cyclic. By Cauchy's theorem there are $a, b \in G$ with $a$ of order $p$ and $b$ of order $q$. Since $(|a|,|b|)=1$ and $a b=b a$ then $|a b|=|a| \cdot|b|=p q$. Therefore $a b$ is an element of order $p q$, the order of $G$, which means $G$ is cyclic.
