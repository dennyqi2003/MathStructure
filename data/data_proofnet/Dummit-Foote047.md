Exercise 4.4.8a Let $G$ be a group with subgroups $H$ and $K$ with $H \leq K$. Prove that if $H$ is characteristic in $K$ and $K$ is normal in $G$ then $H$ is normal in $G$.
Proof.
We prove that $H$ is invariant under every inner automorphism of $G$. Consider a inner automorphism $\phi_g$ of $G$. Now, $\left.\phi_g\right|_K$ is a automorphism of $K$ because $K$ is normal in $G$. But $H$ is a characterestic subgroup of $K$, so $\left.\phi_g\right|_K(H) \subset H$, so in general $\phi_g(H) \subset H$. Hence $H$ is characteretstic in $G$.
