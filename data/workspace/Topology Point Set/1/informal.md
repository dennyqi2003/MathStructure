**Lemma 13.2.**  *Let $X$ be a topological space. Suppose that $\mathcal{C}$ is a collection of open sets of $X$ such that for each open set $U$ of $X$ and each $x$ in $U$, there is an element $C$ of $\mathcal{C}$ such that $x \in C \subset U$. Then $\mathcal{C}$ is a basis for the topology of $X$.*

*Proof.* We must show that $\mathcal{C}$ is a basis. The first condition for a basis is easy: Given $x \in X$, since $X$ is itself an open set, there is by hypothesis an element $C$ of $\mathcal{C}$ such that $x \in C \subset X$. To check the second condition, let $x$ belong to $C_1 \cap C_2$, where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are elements of $\mathcal{C}$. Since $C_1$ and $C_2$ are open, so is $C_1 \cap C_2$. Therefore, there exists by hypothesis an element $C_3$ in $\mathcal{C}$ such that $x \in C_3 \subset C_1 \cap C_2$.

Let $\mathcal{T}$ be the collection of open sets of $X$; we must show that the topology $\mathcal{T}'$ generated by $\mathcal{C}$ equals the topology $\mathcal{T}$. First, note that if $U$ belongs to $\mathcal{T}$ and if $x \in U$, then there is by hypothesis an element $C$ of $\mathcal{C}$ such that $x \in C \subset U$. It follows that $U$ belongs to the topology $\mathcal{T}'$, by definition. Conversely, if $W$ belongs to the topology $\mathcal{T}'$, then $W$ equals a union of elements of $\mathcal{C}$, by the preceding lemma. Since each element of $\mathcal{C}$ belongs to $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ is a topology, $W$ also belongs to $\mathcal{T}$. â–
