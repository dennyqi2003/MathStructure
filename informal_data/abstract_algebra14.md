**3.1.7 Theorem** If $\alpha \in E$ is algebraic over $F$ and the minimal polynomial $m(X)$ of $\alpha$ over $F$ has degree $n$, then $F(\alpha) = F[\alpha]$, the set of polynomials in $\alpha$ with coefficients in $F$. In fact, $F[\alpha]$ is the set $F_{n-1}[\alpha]$ of all polynomials of degree at most $n-1$ with coefficients in $F$, and $1, \alpha, \ldots, \alpha^{n-1}$ form a basis for the vector space $F[\alpha]$ over the field $F$. Consequently, $[F(\alpha) : F] = n$.

*Proof.* Let $f(X)$ be any nonzero polynomial over $F$ of degree $n-1$ or less. Then since $m(X)$ is irreducible and $\deg f < \deg m$, $f(X)$ and $m(X)$ are relatively prime, and there are polynomials $a(X)$ and $b(X)$ over $F$ such that $a(X)f(X) + b(X)m(X) = 1$. But then $a(\alpha)f(\alpha) = 1$, so that any nonzero element of $F_{n-1}[\alpha]$ has a multiplicative inverse. It follows that $F_{n-1}[\alpha]$ is a field. (This may not be obvious, since the product of two polynomials of degree $n-1$ or less can have degree greater than $n-1$, but if $\deg g > n-1$, then divide $g$ by $m$ to get $g(X) = q(X)m(X) + r(X)$ where $\deg r(X) < \deg m(X) = n$. Replace $X$ by $\alpha$ to get $g(\alpha) = r(\alpha) \in F_{n-1}[\alpha]$. Less abstractly, if $m(\alpha) = \alpha^3 + \alpha + 1 = 0$, then $\alpha^3 = -\alpha - 1$, $\alpha^4 = -\alpha^2 - \alpha$, and so on.)

Now any field containing $F$ and $\alpha$ must contain all polynomials in $\alpha$, in particular all polynomials of degree at most $n-1$. Therefore $F_{n-1}[\alpha] \subseteq F[\alpha] \subseteq F(\alpha)$. But $F(\alpha)$ is the smallest field containing $F$ and $\alpha$, so $F(\alpha) \subseteq F_{n-1}[\alpha]$, and we conclude that $F(\alpha) = F[\alpha] = F_{n-1}[\alpha]$. Finally, the elements $1, \alpha, \ldots, \alpha^{n-1}$ certainly span $F_{n-1}[\alpha]$, and they are linearly independent because if a nontrivial linear combination of these elements were zero, we would have a nonzero polynomial of degree less than that of $m(X)$ with $\alpha$ as a root, contradicting (2) of (3.1.6). â™£
