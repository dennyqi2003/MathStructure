LEMMA 2.2. $\text{dim}_{\bold{T}/{\mathfrak{m}} } H^0(X_1(N, p)_{/\bold{F}_p}, \Omega)[\mathfrak{m}] = 1$.

Proof. 

First we remark that the action of the Hecke operator $U_p$ here is most conveniently defined using an extension from characteristic zero. This is explained below. We will first show that $\text{dim}_{\bold{T}/\mathfrak{m}} \, H^0(X_1(N, p)/\bold{F}_p, \Omega)[\mathfrak{m}] \leq 1$, this being the essential step. If we embed $\bold{T}/\mathfrak{m} \hookrightarrow \overline{\bold{F}}_p$ and then set $\mathfrak{m}' = \ker : \bold{T} \otimes \overline{\bold{F}}_p \rightarrow \overline{\bold{F}}_p$ (the map given by $t \otimes a \mapsto at \mod \mathfrak{m}$) then it is enough to show that $\text{dim}_{\overline{\bold{F}}_p} \, H^0(X_1(N, p)_{/\overline{\bold{F}}_p}, \Omega)[\mathfrak{m}'] \leq 1$. First we will suppose that there is no nonzero holomorphic differential in $H^0(X_1(N, p)/\bold{F}_p, \Omega)[\mathfrak{m}']$, i.e., no differential form which pulls back to holomorphic differentials on $\Sigma^{\text{ét}}$ and $\Sigma^{\mu}$. Then if $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ are two differentials in $H^0(X_1(N, p)/\bold{F}_p, \Omega)[\mathfrak{m}']$, the $q$-expansion principle shows that $\mu \omega_1 - \lambda \omega_2$ has zero $q$-expansion at infinity for some pair $(\mu, \lambda) \neq (0, 0)$ in $\bold{F}_p^2$ and thus is zero on $\Sigma^{\mu}$. As $\mu \omega_1 - \lambda \omega_2 = 0$ on $\Sigma^{\mu}$ it is holomorphic on $\Sigma^{\text{ét}}$. By our hypothesis it would then be zero which shows that $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ are linearly dependent.

This use of the $q$-expansion principle in characteristic $p$ is crucial and due to Mazur. The point is simply that all the coefficients in the $q$-expansion are determined by elementary formulae from the coefficient of $q$ provided that $\omega$ is an eigenform for all the Hecke operators. The formulae for the action of these operators in characteristic $p$ follow from the formulae in characteristic zero. To see this formally (especially for the $U_p$ operator) one checks first that $H^0(X_1(N, p)/\bold{Z}_p, \Omega)$, where $\Omega$ denotes the sheaf of regular differentials on $X_1(N, p)/\bold{Z}_p$, behaves well under the base changes $\bold{Z}_p \rightarrow \overline{\bold{Z}}_p$ and $\bold{Z}_p \rightarrow \overline{\bold{Q}}_p$; cf. Mazur or Wiles. The action of the Hecke operators on $J_1(N, p)$ induces an action on the connected component of the Neron model of $J_1(N, p)/\bold{Q}_p$, so also on its tangent space and cotangent space. By Grothendieck duality the cotangent space is isomorphic to $H^0(X_1(N, p)/\bold{Z}_p, \Omega)$; see the context below. (For a summary of the duality statements used in this context, see Mazur. For explicit duality over fields see [AK, Ch. VIII].) This then defines an action of the Hecke operators on this group. To check that over $\overline{\bold{Q}}_p$ this gives the standard action one uses the commutativity of the diagram after Proposition 2.2 in [Mi1].

Now assume that there is a nonzero holomorphic differential in 

$H^0(X_1(N, p)/_{\bold{F}_p}, \Omega)[\mathfrak{m}']$.

We claim that the space of holomorphic differentials then has dimension 1 and that any such differential $\omega \neq 0$ is actually nonzero on $\Sigma^{\mu}$. The dimension claim follows from the second assertion by using the $q$-expansion principle. To prove that $\omega \neq 0$ on $\Sigma^{\mu}$ we use the formula

$U_{p*}(x, y) = (Fx, y')$

for $(x, y) \in (\text{Pic}^0\Sigma^{\text{ét}} \times \text{Pic}^0\Sigma^{\mu})(\overline{\bold{F}}_p)$, where $F$ denotes the Frobenius endomorphism. The value of $y'$ will not be needed. This formula is a variant on the second part of Theorem 5.3 of Wiles where the corresponding result is proved for $X_1(Np)$. (A correction to the first part of Theorem 5.3 was noted in [MW1, p. 188].) One checks then that the action of $U_p$ on $X_0 = H^0(\Sigma^{\mu}, \Omega^1) \oplus H^0(\Sigma^{\text{ét}}, \Sigma^1)$ viewed as a subspace of $H^0(X_1(N, p)/_{\bold{F}_p}, \Omega)$ is the same as the action on $X_0$ viewed as the cotangent space of $\text{Pic}^0\Sigma^{\mu} \times \text{Pic}^0\Sigma^{\text{ét}}$. From this we see that if $\omega = 0$ on $\Sigma^{\mu}$ then $U_p\omega = 0$ on $\Sigma^{\text{ét}}$. But $U_p$ acts as a nonzero scalar which gives a contradiction if $\omega \neq 0$. We can thus assume that the space of $\mathfrak{m}'$-torsion holomorphic differentials has dimension 1 and is generated by $\omega$. So if $\omega_2$ is now any differential in $H^0(X_1(N, p)/\bold{F}_p, \Omega)[\mathfrak{m}']$ then $\omega_2 - \lambda \omega$ has zero $q$-expansion at infinity for some choice of $\lambda$. Then $\omega_2 - \lambda \omega = 0$ on $\Sigma^{\mu}$ whence $\omega_2 - \lambda \omega$ is holomorphic and so $\omega_2 = \lambda \omega$. We have now shown in general that $\text{dim}(H^0(X_1(N, p)/\bold{F}_p, \Omega)[\mathfrak{m}']) \leq 1$.

The singularities of $X_1(N, p)/\bold{Z}_p$ at the supersingular points are formally isomorphic over $\overline{\bold{Z}}_p^{\text{unr}}$ to $\overline{\bold{Z}}_p^{\text{unr}}[[X, Y]]/(XY - p^k)$ with $k = 1, 2$ or $3$. If we consider a minimal regular resolution $M_1(N, p)/\bold{Z}_p$, then $H^0(M_1(N, p)/\bold{F}_p, \Omega) \simeq H^0(X_1(N, p)/\bold{F}_p, \Omega)$, and a similar isomorphism holds for $H^0(M_1(N, p)/\bold{Z}_p, \Omega)$.

As $M_1(N, p)/\bold{Z}_p$ is regular, a theorem of Raynaud says that the connected component of the Neron model of $J_1(N, p)/\bold{Q}_p$ is $J_1(N, p)^0/\bold{Z}_p \simeq \text{Pic}^0(M_1(N, p)/\bold{Z}_p)$. Taking tangent spaces at the origin, we obtain

(2.5) $\text{Tan}(J_1(N, p)^0/\bold{Z}_p) \simeq H^1(M_1(N, p)/\bold{Z}_p, \mathcal{O}_{M_1(N, p)})$.

Reducing both sides mod $p$ and applying Grothendieck duality we get an isomorphism

(2.6) $\text{Tan}(J_1(N, p)^0/\bold{F}_p) \simeq \text{Hom}(H^0(X_1(N, p)/\bold{F}_p, \Omega), \bold{F}_p)$.

Since $\text{Tan}(J_1(N, p)^0/\bold{Z}_p)$ is a faithful $T \otimes \bold{Z}_p$-module it follows that

$H^0(X_1(N, p)/\bold{F}_p, \Omega)[\mathfrak{m}]$

is nonzero. This completes the proof of the lemma. □
