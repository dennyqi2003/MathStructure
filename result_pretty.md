Chain-of-Thought:
I need to refine the first `PlaceHolderNode`. The text is: "Then there exist $c_1, ..., c_m \in \mathbf{F}$ such that

$$u = c_1 v_1 + \cdots + c_m v_m.$$

In the equation above, we can replace $v_k$ with the right side of 2.20, which shows that $u$ is in the span of the list obtained by removing the $k^{th}$ term from $v_1, ..., v_m$. Thus removing the $k^{th}$ term of the list $v_1, ..., v_m$ does not change the span of the list.". I will break this down into logical steps.
1. The first sentence "Then there exist $c_1, ..., c_m \in \mathbf{F}$ such that $u = c_1 v_1 + \cdots + c_m v_m$" is an existential claim based on the fact that $u$ is in the span of the vectors. This corresponds to an `Obtain` node.
2. The second sentence describes the main argument: by substituting the expression for $v_k$, we can show $u$ is in the span of the shorter list. This is a conclusion with a justification, which corresponds to a `Have` node. I will make the justification more explicit by referencing the equations.
3. The final sentence is a concluding statement, summarizing the result of the argument. This is another `Have` node.
Since this breaks down into three nodes, which is within the 2-5 node limit, I will replace the entire placeholder.
