There exist irrational numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a^b$ is rational.
Pf:
The number $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ must either be rational or irrational.
If $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is rational, then let $a = \sqrt{2}$ (irrational) and $b = \sqrt{2}$ (irrational). The result $a^b$ is rational by assumption.
If $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is irrational, then let $a = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ and $b = \sqrt{2}$. Both are irrational. We have $a^b  =\left( \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}} \right)^{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}^{(\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2})} = \sqrt{2}^2 = 2$, which is rational.
the claim is proven.
