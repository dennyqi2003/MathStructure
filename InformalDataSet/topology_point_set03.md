**Theorem 16.3.** *If $A$ is a subspace of $X$ and $B$ is a subspace of $Y$, then the product topology on $A \times B$ is the same as the topology $A \times B$ inherits as a subspace of $X \times Y$.*

*Proof.* The set $U \times V$ is the general basis element for $X \times Y$, where $U$ is open in $X$ and $V$ is open in $Y$. Therefore, $(U \times V) \cap (A \times B)$ is the general basis element for the subspace topology on $A \times B$. Now

$$(U \times V) \cap (A \times \mathbf{B}) = (U \cap A) \times (V \cap \mathbf{B}).$$

Since $U \cap A$ and $V \cap B$ are the general open sets for the subspace topologies on $A$ and $B$, respectively, the set $(U \cap A) \times (V \cap B)$ is the general basis element for the product topology on $A \times B$.

The conclusion we draw is that the bases for the subspace topology on $A \times B$ and for the product topology on $A \times B$ are the same. Hence the topologies are the same. â–
