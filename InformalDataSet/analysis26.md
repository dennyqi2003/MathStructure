**Example 1** Find the general solution of the differential equation $\frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy$.

**Solution** The equation is separable. Separating the variables gives $\frac{dy}{y} = 2x dx.$

Integrating both sides $\int \frac{dy}{y} = \int 2x dx,$

we get $\ln |y| = x^2 + C_1,$

so that $y = \pm e^{x^2 + C_1} = \pm e^{C_1} e^{x^2}.$

Since $\pm e^{C_1}$ is an arbitrary nonzero constant, and $y=0$ is also a solution, we obtain the general solution $y = C e^{x^2}.$
