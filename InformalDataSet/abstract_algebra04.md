**1.1.4 Proposition** If $G$ is a finite cyclic group of order $n$, then $G$ has exactly one (necessarily cyclic) subgroup of order $n/d$ for each positive divisor $d$ of $n$, and $G$ has no other subgroups. If $G$ is an infinite cyclic group, the (necessarily cyclic) subgroups of $G$ are of the form $\{1, b, b^2, \ldots\}$, where $b$ is an arbitrary element of $G$, or in additive notation, $\{0, b, 2b, \ldots\}$.

*Proof.* Again, an informal argument is helpful. Suppose that $H$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{20}$ (the integers with addition modulo 20). If the smallest positive integer in $H$ is 6 (a non-divisor of 20) then $H$ contains 6, 12, 18, 4 (oops, a contradiction, 6 is supposed to be the smallest positive integer). On the other hand, if the smallest positive integer in $H$ is 4, then $H = \{4,8,12,16,0\}$. Similarly, if the smallest positive integer in a subgroup $H$ of the additive group of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ is 5, then $H = \{0, 5, 10, 15, 20, \ldots\}$.â™£
