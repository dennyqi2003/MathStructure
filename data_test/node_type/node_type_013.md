[Fix: {x} st "the sequence {x_n} is bounded in ℝ"]
[Define: "E" as ""E is the set of values of the sequence {x_n}""]
[Assume: "E is finite"]
[Have: "there exists x∈E and a strictly increasing sequence n_1<n_2<⋯ with x_{n_k}=x for all k"]
[Have: "the subsequence {x_{n_k}} is constant and therefore convergent"]
[Assume: "E is infinite"]
[Have: "E has a limit point x" by "Bolzano–Weierstrass principle"]
[Have: "there exists n_1∈ℕ such that |x_{n_1}-x|<1" by "x is a limit point of E"]
[Have: "given n_k with |x_{n_k}-x|<1/k, there exists n_{k+1}>n_k with |x_{n_{k+1}}-x|<1/(k+1)" by "x is a limit point of E"]
