You need to refine the top level of the given JSON mathematical structure. Please complete the task according to the definition of the mathematical structure.

# Requirements

I will give you a structure that has been partially extracted but contains place_holders. Your task is to refine the structure at the location of the first occurrence of a place_holder.

Note, the work you need to do only requires adding 3~5 nodes. If you believe that refining the entire content of the place_holder would not exceed 3~5 nodes, then please refine it entirely. Otherwise, please only refine the topmost 3~5 nodes, and still represent the remaining content with place_holder.

You need to think in the thinking field first, and then output the result in the structure field.
